In Kannada, "pudi" translates to "powder" and is pronounced as "poo-dee". It is commonly used to refer to various spice blends or powders used in South Indian cuisine. These powders, such as [saarina pudi](/rosies-recipes/pudi/saarina-pudi), [huli pudi](/rosies-recipes/pudi/huli-pudi), and [chutney pudi](/rosies-recipes/pudi/chutney-pudi), are made from ground spices and other ingredients that add flavor and aroma to dishes. "Pudi" can be added to soups, gravies, and rice to enhance the taste, and it forms a key part of traditional South Indian cooking.
