Chicken Kathi Roll with Mint Cilantro Chutney is a popular Indian street food featuring tender, spiced chicken wrapped in a soft paratha or flatbread.

## Ingredients

### Marinated Chicken

- 6 Boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 10g Salt
- 3g MSG
- Juice from 1/2 lime
- 1 Spoonful of ground cumin (4g)
- 1 Spoonful Kashmiri chili powder (or cayenne) (2g)
- 1/2 Spoonful of turmeric (1g)
- 15 cranks black pepper
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1-inch knob of ginger, crushed
- 10g tomato paste
- 50g plain yogurt

### Cilantro Mint Chutney

- Juice from 1/2 lime
- 1/2 - 1 Roma tomato
- 5g salt
- 5 fresh birds eye green chilies (or 2 to 3 serrano/jalapeno)
- Large handful of fresh cilantro
- 15 fresh mint leaves
- Water to thin out sauce as needed

### Roll

- 4 to 6 Frozen or fresh made paratha, roti or chapati
- Red onions sliced
- Cilantro mint chutney
- 1 egg, beaten _(optional but recommended)_

## Directions

1. Set the oven on broil over high.
2. Add the peeled garlic cloves and knob of ginger to a mortar and pestle and bash into a rough paste.
3. Cut the chicken into small cubes and add them to a large mixing bowl along with the salt, msg (if using), lime juice, ground cumin, chili powder, turmeric, black pepper, garlic, ginger, tomato paste, and plain yogurt. Mix well and coat every piece. _Note: Cover and marinate in the fridge overnight for best results._
4. Get out a baking sheet and evenly space the chicken so none of the pieces are touching, this will help with even cooking and better browning.
5. Place under the broiler and cook for about 8 to 10 minutes during which some charred pieces should develop.
6. Take them out and flip with a spatula once before cooking for another couple of minutes. Then set aside.
7. While the chicken is cooking, prepare the chutney.
8. Add the lime juice, roma tomato, salt, green chiles, a handful of cilantro, the mint leaves, and grated coconut to a blender and pulse until completely smooth.
9. Thin out with water as needed. Taste it! Add more salt or citrus juice as needed.
10. Set a pan over medium heat and add some ghee or oil. Place a frozen or fresh-made paratha and gently cook until golden brown and crispy on both sides. _Note: If you want to make it an egg roll, scramble one egg and pour it on one side of the golden brown paratha. Flip once and cook the egg face down before assembling the Kathi roll._
11. Assemble the roll. Spread a spoonful or two of the chutney on the bottom followed by a serving of the chicken. Garnish with sliced onions, thinly sliced cucumber, and more chutney as needed.
