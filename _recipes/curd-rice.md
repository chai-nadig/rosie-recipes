This curd rice recipe is my comfort food. Easy on the tummy, yummy on the tongue, and satisfying for the heart. Super easy to make, with a touch of South India.

## Ingredients

## Directions

1. Boil Rice (your assistant can’t teach you how to cook rice, so assuming you know this)
2. The rice has to be softer than what we cook on a daily basis. Basically the grains should have a mushy texture after getting cooked.
3. With a spoon or masher, mash the rice. Close the cooker and allow the rice to cool down.
4. Take the mashed rice in a mixing bowl or you can even keep it in the cooker if you want. Cover and let the rice become lukewarm or come to room temperature.
5. When the cooked rice comes to room temperature and cools completely, add 1 cup fresh curd.
6. Add salt as per taste.
7. Mix very well. Keep aside. Check the taste and add more salt if required (don’t eat all of it just yet)

## Tempering (tadka)

8. Heat a small pan or tadka pan and add 1 tablespoon of oil in it.
9. When the oil is hot, add ½ teaspoon mustard seeds. Keep heat to a low.

10. Let the mustard seeds begin to crackle.
11. Don’t get scared :)
12. When the mustard seeds crackle, add ½ teaspoon urad dal.
13. Remember to smell it, and enjoyyyy the aroma.
14. Stirring often, fry the urad dal.
15. Let the urad dal become golden.
16. Then, add 5 to 6 chopped curry leaves and ⅛ teaspoon asafoetida (roughly 2 pinches of asafoetida). Mix and switch off the heat.
17. Immediately pour the tempering on the Curd Rice.
18. Mix very well, once again.
19. You can garnish Curd Rice with a few coriander leaves and pomegranate

Most important - Enjoy :)
