---

Puliyogare is a tangy and spicy South Indian tamarind rice dish, flavored with puliyogare pudi, tamarind paste, and garnished with roasted peanuts and fried lentils.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups cooked rice _(preferably cooled)_
- 2 tablespoons [puliyogare pudi](/rosies-recipes/pudi/puliyogare-pudi)
- 1 tablespoon tamarind paste _(adjust to taste)_
- 2 tablespoons oil or ghee
- 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
- 1 tablespoon peanuts or cashews
- 1 tablespoon chana dal
- 1 tablespoon urad dal
- 2 dried red chilies
- A pinch of asafoetida (hing)
- 1-2 sprigs of curry leaves
- Salt to taste

## Directions

1. **Prepare the Rice:**

   - Cook 2 cups of rice and allow it to cool slightly. Spread it out on a plate to avoid clumping.

2. **Tempering:**

   - In a large pan, heat oil or ghee. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.
   - Add peanuts (or cashews), chana dal, urad dal, and dried red chilies. Fry until the lentils turn golden brown and the peanuts are roasted.
   - Add curry leaves and a pinch of hing, stirring for a few seconds until fragrant.

3. **Mix in Tamarind and Puliyogare Pudi:**

   - Add tamarind paste and puliyogare pudi to the tempering. Stir well and cook for 1-2 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.

4. **Combine with Rice:**

   - Add the cooled rice to the pan. Gently mix everything together until the rice is evenly coated with the puliyogare mixture. Adjust salt if needed.

5. **Serve:**
   - Serve hot with papad or raita on the side.

Enjoy your delicious and tangy puliyogare!
