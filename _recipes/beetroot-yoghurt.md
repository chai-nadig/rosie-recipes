Beetroot Yoghurt commonly known as Thayir Pachadi in the south of India is a delicious preparation using semi cooked Beetroot and thick yogurt or curd.

Thayir Pachadi is made South Indian style with the goodness of aromatic tempering and curry leaves. Mix it with plain rice or a side dish with biryani or even parantha.

## Ingredients:

- 1 half boiled Beetroot grated
- 200 ml curd/yoghurt
- Half Onion chopped
- One Tomato Chopped
- 1 green chilli chopped
- A few mint leaves
- Milk Powder (optional)
- A few Curry Leaves (Kadi Patta)
- 2 spoons of mustard seeds
- 2 spoons of Urad Dal (or any other split pulses that can be used for simmering or tadka)
- 2 Whole dried red chillies
- Half a spoon Asofetida (Hing)
- 2 tablespoons of Roasted Cumin Powder (Bhuna Jeera
  Powder)
- Salt to taste

## Preparation of the curd:

1.⁠ ⁠Hang the curd overnight or for a few hours in a muslin cloth or a sieve. You should be able to drain all its water for thick & creamy curd. The curd should become a thick consistency like Greek yoghurt.
2.⁠ ⁠⁠Put the curd in a blender, add a few spoons of the whey (curd water) and some milk powder for adding that extra thickness to your curd. Churn them all together in a blender.

## Method

1. ⁠Add the grated Beetroot, onions, tomatoes, green chillies and mint leaves to the curd. Add the salt and cumin powder or bhuna jeera to the curd. Adjust according to taste.
2. ⁠For the tempering: in a pan heat some oil. Add curry leaves, mustard leaves, urad Dal, red chillies and a pinch of asafoetida. Let it temper. Be careful not to burn the tempering.
3. ⁠Pour the tempering on top of the yogurt and chill.

You are now ready to eat! Enjoy!

_Tip: Add some milk powder to your curd to make it even more creamy and rich._
