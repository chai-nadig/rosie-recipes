Eliott's Hallots is a sweet, braided bread similar to traditional Challah.

## Ingredients

For 3 hallots

- 1kg flour
- 125g of sunflower oil
- 100gr sugar
- 22gr salt (add for 2nd growing time)
- 27gr yeast
- 400g of warm water (more or less)

## Directions

1. On one side of your mixing bowl, place all the solid ingredients (flour, sugar, yeast). On the other side, add the liquid ingredients (oil and warm water).
2. Mix the solids and liquids together until they form a dough.
3. Let the dough rise for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
4. After the first rise, braid the dough to form the hallots (or challahs).
5. Let the braided dough rise again for 45 minutes, adding the salt at this stage.
6. Brush the top of the braided dough with a beaten egg to give the bread a golden, shiny crust.
7. Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for about 25 minutes until the bread is golden brown.
