Lemon Drizzle Traybake is a light and moist cake infused with the zesty freshness of lemon.

## Ingredients

### For the sponge

- ⁠225g unsalted butter, diced and softened
- ⁠⁠225g caster sugar
- ⁠⁠275g self-raising flour
- ⁠⁠2 tsp baking powder
  ⁠⁠- 4 large eggs
  ⁠⁠- 50ml whole milk
- ⁠⁠zest of 3 large unwaxed lemons

### For the drizzle

- ⁠Juice of 3 large lemons
- ⁠⁠150g granulated sugar

### To decorate:

- ⁠100g caster sugar

1. Heat the oven to 170°C/150°C fan/325°F/Gas 3.
2. Put all the sponge ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the beater attachment. Beat the mixture for 2 minutes on medium speed until smooth.
3. Transfer the mixture to the prepared traybake tin and smooth the top. Bake for 35–40 minutes, until springy to touch and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Remove from the oven and set aside while you make the drizzle.
4. Stir together the lemon juice and sugar. Using a cocktail stick, poke holes all over the sponge and spoon the drizzle all over. Leave to cool in the tin.
5. Make the decoration. In a medium pan, dissolve the sugar in 100ml of water. Add the lemon slices and simmer over a low heat for 15 minutes to soften the lemon slices. Use a fork lift the slices out of the pan and arrange them in 3 rows of 4 slices over the top of the cake.
6. Remove the cake from the tin and cut it into squares – with a lemon slice on top of each. Serve. 1 or 2 lemons, cut into 12 thin slices
