## Ingredients

   - Allow the rasam to simmer on low heat for about 5-7 minutes.

3. **Prepare the Tempering:**

   - In a small pan, heat ghee or oil. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds, and let them splutter.
   - Add dried red chilies, curry leaves, and asafoetida (hing), and saut√© for a few seconds until fragrant.

4. **Final Touch:**

   - Pour the tempering over the simmering rasam and stir well.
