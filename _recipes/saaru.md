pudi: "Saarina Pudi (Rasam Powder)"
---

Saaru, also known as Rasam, is a tangy and spicy South Indian soup made from tamarind, lentils, and a special blend of spices called saarina pudi (rasam powder).

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoon saarina pudi (rasam powder)
- 1 small lemon-sized ball of tamarind (or 1 tablespoon tamarind paste)
- 1 medium tomato, chopped
- 1/4 cup cooked toor dal (tuvar dal / yellow split peas / pigeon peas)
- 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1/2 teaspoon jaggery _(optional, for sweetness)_
- Salt to taste
- 2 cups water
- Fresh coriander leaves for garnish

### Tempering

- 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 2 dried red chilies
- 1-2 sprigs curry leaves
- A pinch of asafoetida (hing)
- 1 tablespoon ghee or oil

## Prepare Tamarind Water

Soak the tamarind in 1/4 cup of warm water for about 10 minutes. Squeeze out the juice and discard the pulp (or use tamarind paste directly).

## Directions

1. In a pot, add the tamarind water, chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, and jaggery.
2. Add 2 cups of water and bring the mixture to a boil.
3. Once the tomatoes soften, mash them slightly with a spoon.
4. Add the cooked toor dal and mix well.
5. Stir in the saarina pudi (rasam powder) and salt to taste.
6. Allow the rasam to simmer on low heat for about 5-7 minutes.
7. Adjust the consistency by adding more water if needed.

## Tempering

1. In a small pan, heat ghee or oil.
2. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds, and allow them to crackle.
3. Add dried red chilies, curry leaves, and a pinch of asafoetida (hing).
4. Fry for a few seconds until fragrant.

## Final Touch

1. Pour the tempering over the rasam and give it a good stir.
2. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
3. Serve the hot saaru (rasam) with steamed rice and a dollop of ghee, or enjoy it as a flavorful soup.
