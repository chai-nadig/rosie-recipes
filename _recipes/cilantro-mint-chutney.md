Cilantro Mint Chutney is a vibrant, tangy, and refreshing Indian condiment made from fresh cilantro (coriander leaves), mint leaves, green chilies, lemon juice, and a few spices.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups fresh mint leaves
- 4 cups cilantro or coriander leaves and stems
- 3 - 4 green finger hot chilies with seeds _(optional)_
- 1/2 medium white onion coarsely chopped
- 1 clove of garlic
- 1 inch piece of ginger peeled and coarsely chopped
- Juice of 2 lemons
- 1 tsp cumin powder _(optional)_
- 1/4 tsp black salt or sea salt or regular salt (as per taste)
- 1-2 Tbsp water
- 1 Tbsp jaggery (or brown sugar) optional

## Directions

- ⁠Combine all the ingredients in a blender and puree until smooth.
- It should be a thick sauce like consistence.

Good enough for you to dunk into or spread on your bread or roti.

_Tip: Resist the urge to add more water. Instead, keep blending and scrape down the sides as needed. Patience is key—your mixture will reach the right consistency with a bit of persistence!_
