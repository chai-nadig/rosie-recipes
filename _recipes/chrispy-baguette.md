Super easy Baguette for on the fly. You can prepare it the day before and even freeze it. Best to consume freshly out of the oven though, when it’s still warm.

## Ingredients

- 450g white flour
- 50g whole wheat flour
- 350g warm water (or 375g if you are already a seasoned baker)
- 10g of yeast or 4g of active yeast
- 10g of salt

## Instructions

1. Mix all ingredients in a bowl (by hand) and let rest for 15 minutes.
2. Do 2-3 sets of stretch and fold every 30 minutes. Stretch the dough and fold the sides. Cover the bowl to let the dough grow in between.
   Let the dough rest for 12-24h with a cover
3. Preheat the oven to 250°
4. Release the dough from the bowl with a dough scraper. Try to deflate it as little as possible.
5. Make 4 pieces.
6. To shape the baguette fold the sides into the middle (try to deflate as little as possible) and seal the ends by rolling them out.
7. Use a dough cutter or knife to cut in the top
8. Bake for 15-20 mins or until golden brown. Add a bowl of water in the first half to steam the bread.

Enjoy without moderation.
