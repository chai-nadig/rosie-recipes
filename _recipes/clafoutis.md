Cherries clafoutis from the French region of Limousin

## Ingredients

- 1 1⁄4 cups milk
- 2⁄3 cup sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1 tablespoon of vanilla
- 1⁄8 teaspoon of salt
- 1⁄2 cup of flour
- 3 cups of cherries (dark and ripe cherries)
- Powdered sugar for decoration

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Using a blender, combine the milk, 1/3 cup sugar, eggs, vanilla, salt and flour, and blend.
3. Lightly butter an 8-cup baking dish, and pour a 1/4-inch layer of the blended mixture over the bottom. Set remaining batter aside.
4. Place dish into the oven for about 7-10 minutes, until a film of batter sets in the pan but the mixture is not baked through.
5. Remove from oven (but don’t turn the oven off, yet).
6. Distribute the pitted cherries over the set batter in the pan, then sprinkle with the remaining sugar.
7. Pour the remaining batter over the cherries and sugar.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 60 minutes, until the clafouti is puffed and brown and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
9. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve warm.
