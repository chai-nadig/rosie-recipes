This recipe is super easy and always a winner – whether it’s just the two of you or a group of friends on a mild late Summer night in Ibiza. A complete family favourite.

## Ingredients

- 300 – 500g Pasta of your liking, depending on people. I recommend Paccheri or Rigatoni for a maximum ‘soak up’ effect
- A big bowl of fresh tomatoes, I like to mix different kinds from cherry tomatoes, red and yellow to Ox Heart Tomatoes…but honestly anything goes
- 1 Bell Pepper _(optional)_
- 1 Onion _(optional)_
- Loads of parmesan
- 50g Butter (or to your liking)
- Olive Oil
- Salt and Pepper
- Basil

## Directions

1. Cut the tomatoes in half or smaller pieces, the bell pepper in stripes and the onion in wedges.
2. Place everything on a baking tray and roast at 180-220° for 30-45 minutes until the veggies are crumbling on the edges and getting tanned.
3. Heat the olive oil in the pot. Add all the vegetables in there and give a good stir.
4. Use a blender to smoothen the veggies to an even sauce, add a good bowl of parmesan and a big shrivel of butter in there until the sauce turns creamy.
5. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Serve with your pasta cooked al dente and decorate with basil leaves.

Done and dusted.
