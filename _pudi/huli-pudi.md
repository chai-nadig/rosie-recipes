Huli pudi, commonly known as sambar powder, is a vital spice blend in South Indian kitchens.

## _The Heart of South Indian Curries_

Used to make sambar, a lentil-based vegetable stew, this powder imparts a distinct flavor and aroma to the dish. The term “huli” in Kannada means sour, reflecting the slightly tangy nature of the stew, which is balanced by the rich spices in the powder. Sambar is a staple across South India, and the preparation of huli pudi plays a significant role in the unique flavor of this beloved dish.

### Ingredients and Preparation

The ingredients for huli pudi typically consist of a harmonious blend of spices and lentils. Key components include dried red chilies for heat, coriander seeds for an earthy base, and cumin seeds for a mild, peppery flavor. In addition, fenugreek seeds are often used for a touch of bitterness, while black pepper adds another layer of spiciness. Turmeric is added for its vibrant color and earthy undertones, and hing (asafoetida) brings a pungent aroma.

Roasted lentils like chana dal and urad dal are also crucial to the mixture, providing body and thickness to the sambar once the powder is added to it. Curry leaves, a quintessential ingredient in South Indian cooking, are often dry-roasted and added to the spice mix to enhance the aroma. Some recipes also include a bit of cinnamon or cloves for a touch of sweetness and warmth. All these ingredients are dry roasted individually to release their oils, which helps to enhance their flavors. After roasting, they are ground together into a fine powder that can be stored in an airtight container for several months.

### Culinary Uses

Huli pudi is most famously used in the preparation of sambar, where it is the key ingredient that defines the dish. Sambar is typically made by boiling lentils with vegetables, tamarind, and water, then adding the huli pudi to infuse the stew with its rich, complex flavor. The spices in the powder blend with the lentils and tamarind to create a tangy, spicy, and aromatic dish that pairs perfectly with rice, dosa, or idli.

Beyond sambar, huli pudi can be used in other South Indian gravies and curries. It is sometimes added to rasam, another popular South Indian soup, or sprinkled over stir-fried vegetables to give them a spicy kick. Some households also use sambar powder as a base for other tamarind-based dishes like huli saaru or even as a flavoring in rice dishes. Its versatility makes it a go-to spice blend for quick curries and gravies.

### Pairing with Dishes

Huli pudi is traditionally used to make sambar, which is served with a variety of South Indian staples like rice, dosa, idli, and vada. Sambar, with its combination of lentils, vegetables, tamarind, and spices, is a complete meal when paired with steamed rice. The slightly tangy and spicy stew brings warmth and depth to otherwise simple dishes.

The powder can also be used in other dishes that accompany these staples. For example, you can use huli pudi to make quick tamarind-based gravies or even sprinkle it over dry vegetable stir-fries to give them an extra punch. It pairs especially well with dishes that have a mild base, as the rich spice mix adds a bold and exciting contrast.

### Conclusion

Huli pudi, or sambar powder, is a cornerstone of South Indian cuisine. Its bold blend of spices defines the signature taste of sambar and many other traditional dishes. The unique combination of heat, earthiness, and tanginess brought by ingredients like dried chilies, coriander, cumin, and tamarind makes it an essential part of everyday cooking in South Indian homes. Whether used in sambar, other tamarind-based stews, or as a general-purpose spice blend, huli pudi adds depth and complexity to a wide range of meals, ensuring that the flavors of South India are always at the forefront.
